# Odin-recipes

This is my first Odin-Project homework. It's about food recipes. 

The project will only contain a HTML site with links to some food recipes. It will be 
very minimalistic and it will consist of:

1.A short header that will like make a small introduction to the project.
2.An ordered list with the recipes that will be links to the actual recipes.
3.Maybe a funny image hehe :D.

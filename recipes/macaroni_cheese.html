    <h1>MAcaroni and cheese.</h1>
    <img src = "../images/macaroane.jpg ">
    <p>Macaroni and cheese recipe. The only serious recipe in this project. It's one of my favorite meals actually. Not that dense from a caloric pov if u ask me(164kcal per 100g), but it isn't something healthy either.</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Boil Macaroni</h2>
        <p>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.<br>
        Tip: For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni.</p>
